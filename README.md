Each file is a different classifier and method of implementing.
The 3 data sets that are required have been uploaded, and the file "naremoved" is the discretized version of the initial data.
The other data set is labelled "discrete replicates as attributes", and is to be used in the files labelled "method 3"

Each file has a first line stating which data set is being used.
